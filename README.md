gradebook web app
Hello,

I have created a web application called CS50 Gradebook. I am currently a teacher, so a gradebook was the most "useful" tool I could think to created.

The Gradebook web app allows you first of all to register using a username, subject and a password.

After registering, you are redirected to the login page. Once logged in you will see a table showing your classes and the size of each class.
On first login, this table will be empty. From the nav bar you have the abilitycreate a class, add and remove students from a class,
as well as view your current classes.

Once a class is created, you can create, delete and view assignments which can be of 3 types - homework, classwork or test.

After creating an assignment, you can now enter grades for each student and save them. Subsequently, you can view grades by class or by student,
as well as edit a student's grade.
